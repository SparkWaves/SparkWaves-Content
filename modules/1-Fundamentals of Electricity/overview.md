In this lesson, we will learn the fundamentals of electricity. Understanding how electricity flows is key to understand how electronics work. To learn these concepts, we are going to watch a couple videos which compare the flow of electricity to the flow of water. Using this analogy, we will get a good understanding of:

* Charge
* Current
* Voltage
* Resistance
