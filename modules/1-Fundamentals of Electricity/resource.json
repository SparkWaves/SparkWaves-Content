    "description": "We just learned that current is the flow of electrons in a wire. However, if you look at circuit diagrams, they show positive charges (protons) flowing from positive voltage to negative voltage instead of a negative charge (electrons) flowing from a negative voltage to a positive voltage. This quick video explains why this is the case and why we don't care.",
